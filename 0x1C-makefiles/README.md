The makefile is a text file that contains the recipe for building your program. It usually resides in the same directory as the sources, and it is usually called Makefile. 

If you want to run or update a task when certain files are updated, the make utility can come in handy. The make utility requires a file, Makefile (or makefile), which defines set of tasks to be executed. You may have used make to compile a program from source code. Most open source projects use make to compile a final executable binary, which can then be installed using make install.
