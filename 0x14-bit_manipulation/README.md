<h1>0x14. C - Bit manipulation</h1>

Bit manipulation is a programming technique that involves manipulating individual bits within a binary representation of data. In most programming languages, data is stored in binary format, composed of 0s and 1s, at the lowest level. Bit manipulation allows you to perform operations at the binary level, which can be more efficient in certain situations compared to higher-level operations.

Bit manipulation is often used in various scenarios, including:

**Flag manipulation**: Storing multiple Boolean values in a single integer to conserve memory.

**Optimizing code**: Performing bitwise operations can be faster than equivalent arithmetic operations.

**Masks and filters**: Extracting or modifying specific bits within a binary representation.

**Cryptography**: Building and manipulating cryptographic algorithms that operate at the bit level.
